# ‚ùì Duplicate Question Detection using ML

A Machine Learning-powered web app to detect if two given questions are duplicates, inspired by Quora's question pair challenge.


Our model uses a comprehensive set of features including basic text statistics, token overlap features, length-based metrics, fuzzy string matching scores, and TF-IDF vector representations to accurately capture the similarity between question pairs. .

## üß† Problem Statement

Given two questions (e.g., from a forum like Quora), determine whether they are semantically similar or duplicates of each other.

This helps reduce redundancy in platforms by merging identical questions and improving user experience.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Name**: Quora Question Pairs Dataset  
- **Download Link**: [Quora Duplicate Questions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data)

## Features Used

The model leverages a comprehensive set of features engineered to capture various aspects of similarity between question pairs. These features include:

### 1. Basic Text Features
- Character length of each question
- Word count of each question
- Number of common words between the two questions
- Total number of words in both questions combined
- Word share ratio (common words divided by total words)

### 2. Token-based Features
- Ratio of common non-stopwords (minimum and maximum denominators)
- Ratio of common stopwords (minimum and maximum denominators)
- Ratio of common tokens overall (minimum and maximum denominators)
- Binary indicators if the first words of both questions are the same
- Binary indicators if the last words of both questions are the same

### 3. Length-based Features
- Absolute difference in the number of tokens between the two questions
- Average length of both questions (in tokens)
- Longest common substring ratio relative to the smaller question length

### 4. Fuzzy Matching Features
- Fuzzy ratio (QRatio) between questions
- Partial fuzzy ratio
- Token sort ratio
- Token set ratio

### 5. TF-IDF Features
- TF-IDF vector representations of questions to capture weighted word importance based on corpus statistics

These features help the model effectively identify subtle semantic and lexical similarities, contributing to its overall accuracy in detecting duplicate questions.


## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Input**: Two user-provided questions
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - HTML stripping, lowercasing, contraction expansion
   - Lemmatization using spaCy
   - TF-IDF vectorization
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Token overlap, fuzzy ratios, length difference, etc.
4. **Prediction**:
   - Model predicts 1 if the questions are duplicates, 0 otherwise
